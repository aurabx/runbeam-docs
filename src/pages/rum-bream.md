# Rum Bream

A coastal twist on classic pan-fried fish, Rum Bream marries the sweetness of dark rum with citrus, butter, and a touch of smoke. Perfect with coconut rice or charred pineapple salsa.

## Ingredients (serves 2–3)

- 2 whole sea bream, cleaned and scaled
- 2 tbsp dark rum (preferably a spiced one)
- Juice and zest of 1 lime
- 1 tbsp brown sugar
- 1 small red chilli, finely sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, crushed
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- 1 knob butter (about 25 g)
- 1 handful fresh coriander, chopped
- Sea salt and cracked black pepper, to taste

### Optional garnish

- Charred lime halves
- Shaved coconut or pineapple salsa

## Method

1. **Marinate** – In a bowl, combine rum, lime juice and zest, brown sugar, soy sauce, chilli, garlic, and olive oil. Stir until the sugar dissolves.

2. **Prepare the fish** – Pat the bream dry and score the skin on both sides. Rub a little salt and pepper into the slashes. Place the fish in a shallow dish and pour over the marinade. Let sit for 30–45 minutes, turning once.

3. **Cook** – Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add the butter and let it foam. Place the fish in the pan and spoon over some marinade. Cook for 3–4 minutes per side until the skin crisps and the flesh is opaque.

4. **Glaze** – In the final minute, splash the remaining marinade into the pan. It will bubble and thicken into a glossy glaze. Spoon it over the fish as it caramelises slightly.

5. **Serve** – Transfer the bream to a platter, drizzle with pan juices, and scatter chopped coriander over the top. Add charred lime halves for squeezing at the table.

## Serving ideas

- With coconut rice and grilled vegetables.
- Over a bed of mango and avocado salad.
- As a share dish with rum mojitos or ginger beer.
